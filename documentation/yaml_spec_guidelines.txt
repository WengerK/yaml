- This is also the case in practice; every JSON file is also a valid YAML file.
- Example 2.16.  Indentation determines scope
- YAMLâ€™s flow scalars include the plain style (most examples thus far) and two quoted styles. The double-quoted style provides escape sequences. The single-quoted style is useful when escaping is not needed. All flow scalars can span multiple lines; line breaks are always folded.
- Global tags are URIs and may be specified in a tag shorthand notation using a handle. Application-specific local tags may also be used.
    explicit tag:
        not-date: !!str 2002-04-28
    global tag:
        %TAG ! tag:clarkevans.com,2002:
        --- !shape
          # Use the ! handle for presenting
          # tag:clarkevans.com,2002:circle
        - !circle
          center: &ORIGIN {x: 73, y: 129}
- # Sets are represented as a Mapping where each key is associated with a null value
    --- !!set
    ? Mark McGwire
    ? Sammy Sosa
    ? Ken Griff
    equivlent type in PHP ???
- # Ordered maps are represented as A sequence of mappings, with each mapping having one key
    --- !!omap
    - Mark McGwire: 65
    - Sammy Sosa: 63
    - Ken Griffy: 58
    equivalent type in PHP ??? : arrays ?
- Therefore the YAML processor is required to introduce various presentation details when creating the stream, such as the choice of node styles, how to format scalar content, the amount of indentation, which tag handles to use, the node tags to leave unspecified, the set of directives to provide and possibly even what comments to add. While some of this can be done with the help of the application, in general this process should be guided by the preferences of the user.
-  Construction can fail due to the unavailability of the required native data types.
